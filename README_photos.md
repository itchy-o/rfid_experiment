## About this `photos` branch

To keep the `main` branch as small as possible
(so it can be checked out directly into the limited storage of embedded targets), this
[photos](https://github.com/itchy-o/rfid_experiment/tree/photos)
branch is a separate area to store large photograph files.

The filesystems of the `main` and `photos` branches are intentionally very similar,
so they _theoretically_ could be merged together without any collisions.
