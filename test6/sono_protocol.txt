This doc describes the protocol for messages sent by Sono Chapel pods.

Messages are sent via WiFi to UDP port 12345.
The messages are space-delimited ASCII strings.
Messages are only sent from the pods to the receiving server;
pods do not have any mechanism to receive messages.

There are three message types.
Any of the message types can be sent at any time.
The message sequence counter is incremented after every send.


===============================================================================
1. The BOOT message
This message is sent when a pod is (re)started.
It indicates the protocol being used, and that the pod's message counter
is reset to zero.

Format:
    BOOT pid seq version
where:
    - "BOOT" [str] : the message type.
    - pid [uint] : pod id number.
    - seq [uint] : message sequence counter; always "0" for BOOT message.
    - version [str] : protocol version; i.e.: this document version.

Example:
    "BOOT 5 0 0.1.0.2"
indicates pod 5 is using protocol version "0.1.0.2"


===============================================================================
2. The DATA message
This message is periodically sent to report pod position and status.

Format:
    DATA pid seq posx posy touch1 scnt
where:
    - "DATA" [str] : the message type.
    - pid [uint] : pod id number.
    - seq [uint] : message sequence counter.
    - posx [float] : pod X position.
    - posy [float] : pod Y position.
    - touch1 [bool] : touch sensor 1 status (0=not touched, 1=touched).
    - scnt [uint] : count of sensors actually detecting tags.

Example:
    "DATA 3 123 2.34 4.56 1 2"
indicates the 123rd message sent by pod 3 since BOOT.
The pod is at position (2.34,4.56), that position is computed from two sensors
detecting tags, and it is being touched.

Position units are determined by the tag panel; see tag_coords.py.
Valid position values are > 0.0.
Position values <= 0.0 indicate an unknown position.

If scnt=0 (i.e.: no tags are actually being detected), the last known position
continues to be reported.

===============================================================================
3. The INFO message
This message is sent to report arbitrary diagnostic information.

Format:
    INFO pid seq str
where:
    - "INFO" [str] : the message type.
    - pid [uint] : pod id number.
    - seq [uint] : message sequence counter.
    - str [str] : an arbitrary string, possibly containing embedded spaces.

Example:
    "INFO 1 5432 walking on the ceiling"
indicates the 5432nd message sent by pod 1 since BOOT.
